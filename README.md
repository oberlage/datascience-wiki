# Oberon's Datascience Wiki

## What is this?
During my bachelor I learnt a lot, but never took the time to relate all concepts to eachother. Which I now see as a missed opportunity.
So as I started my new Data Science study, I thought it would be a good idea to try to organise the concepts in one place.

Currently, the list below is more of a braindump of concepts and terms related to Data Science that crossed my path last year.
It's obviously a work in progress ðŸ˜¬
